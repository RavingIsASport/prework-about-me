        <h2>Bio</h2>
        <p id="para2">A house party can be the perfect place for creative minds to sync. It happened with Samir and Diego, the Dutch duo better known as Moksi, although it took a few years for them to perfect their kaleidoscopic sound of screaming leads and bassface-perfect subwoofer-loving drops, inspired by a mutual love of late-’90s UK garage.
            Moksi’s first ‘track’ was nothing more than a 45-second snippet—which later became ‘Getting Higher’—but even that was enough to get them noticed by Yellow Claw. Soon after, Samir and Diego were recording their debut EP Brace Yourself (which includes ‘Getting Higher’) for Yellow Claw’s Barong Family label: no high expectations, just having some fun and tinkering with a couple of melodic ideas. Needless to say, the release blew up and led to Moksi playing their first ever DJ gig at the huge Tomorrowland festival in 2015.</p>
